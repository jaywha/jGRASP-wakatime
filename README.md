# Wakatime for jGRASP
My first foray into making tool plugins for an IDE.  
This plug-in is based off of the Checkstyle tool extension implementation (for getting used to the Plugin API for jGRASP).  
Also based off of the Wakatime eclipse plug-in made by [Alan Hamlett](https://github.com/wakatime/eclipse-wakatime/commits?author=alanhamlett).
